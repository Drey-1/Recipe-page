# Frontend Mentor – Recipe Page Solution 

This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm).  
The objective of this project was to replicate a static design as accurately as possible using only the provided reference image (no Figma).

## Overview

### The challenge

- Build a responsive recipe page based on a static design reference
- Replicate spacing, typography, colors, and layout as closely as possible
- Use semantic HTML and clean, well-structured CSS
- Ensure good responsiveness and overall quality
